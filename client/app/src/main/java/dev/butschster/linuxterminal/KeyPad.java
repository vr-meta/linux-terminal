/**
 * The keys that never move.
 *
 * <p>This is not an accelerator strip — it is the keyboard. The Quest's own on-screen
 * keyboard has no Escape and no Control, so without these keys a terminal cannot be
 * used at all, and FR-17 says they must always be one press away.
 *
 * <p>Which means they must obey keyboard rules: a key never moves, never disappears and
 * never changes meaning. It is built once, here, in a grid of fixed slots, and the
 * context that rebuilds the rest of the bar four times a second never touches it. The
 * previous version placed these keys last in a list whose earlier groups changed length,
 * so typing `claude` moved Enter and ^C to a different row — the exact failure the Touch
 * Bar is remembered for, committed against the keys that matter most.
 *
 * <p>Everything here is universally meaningful. Nothing tool-specific is allowed in, or
 * slots would have to empty out and the grid would reshuffle again.
