/**
 * The link between a terminal window and the bar window.
 *
 * <p>The bar lives in its own task so the shell can place and resize it independently —
 * that is the whole reason it is not docked under the terminal. Two tasks of the same app
 * still share one process, so this is a plain static registry rather than anything that
 * has to cross a process boundary.
 *
 * <p>With several terminals open the bar follows the one last brought to the front, which
 * is the only definition of "the one you are working in" available to a 2D app: Horizon OS
 * does not tell an app which of its windows the user is looking at, only which resumed
 * last.
